`Filters`

Filters help prevent spam and raiding, so that's why filters are in place.
Note that tripping the filter will cause such things to happen, or even saying a filtered word.

- Saying a filtered word = **1-hour mute**  
- Bypassing a filtered word = **verbal warning**, and the bypassed word will be added to the filter.
- Multiply bypassing a filtered word = **Warn + 3 day mute**
- Multiply bypassing a filtered word + Rule 2 breakings = **PERMA BAN**

Joking about a filter (example: `i wanna kys someone /j`) will still count as being serious, seriously don't joke about it.
